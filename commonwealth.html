		<h1>Commonwealth Hall</h1>
		<hr/>
		<p>Students of commonwealth hall are known as VANDALS, an acronym for VIVACIOUS, AFFABLE, NEIGHBORLY, DEVOTED, ALTRIUSTIC and LOYAL.  They address each other as V-MATES and the popular response is SHARP.  It is the only male hall on campus. It is also the only hall that upholds customs and traditions. VANDALS are said to be arguably the voices of the entire student body. They pride themselves with leadership qualities and unity, no wonder OLD VANDALS are always proud of the hall. You dare not go to the romantic vandal city in RED if you are a girl.

MOTTO: TRUTH STANDS.</p>
